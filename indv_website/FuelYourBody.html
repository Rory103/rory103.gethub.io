    <p>I am sure you have each heard the phrase <strong><q>you are what you eat.</q></strong> It may be an old phrase that reminds you of childhood but donâ€™t be fooled to doubt the validity of that statement. Our bodies carry out all the functions for survival. These
    functions are not something that could happen without our bodies having the fuel that it needs to take care of them.</p>
    
    <p>Each body is individual but we all need nutrients to keep us going. I am certain you have heard about the essentials for which our bodies need tons of (macronutrients): 
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc"><li>protein</li><li>carbohydrates</li><li>fats</li></ul>
    And have probably heard micronutrients, like vitamins and minerals, mentioned with maybe less frequency . A good mixture is necessary to carry out all our regular functions and be healthy humans.</p>
    
    <p> In our ever so inquisitive world, there has been a plethora of speculation that to be healthy we need to cut a whole food group or dramatically minimize our intake of certain macronutrients. Dear friends, that is <strong>FALSE!</strong> Our bodies are amazing and they need <strong>a good, balanced mixture</strong> of these nutrients to be in tip top shape.</p>
    
    <p>Below you can find more details of the macronutrients necessary, links to educational information, as well as the ability to browse different supplement suggestions to aid in keeping your body healthy with the needed nutrients.</p>
